I am a **dynamic** and results-driven **Senior Manager** with over 10 years of experience in the BPO industry. I specialize in **Operations Management, Process Improvement, Client Relationship Management, and delivering exceptional customer service** across international and domestic markets.

Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve successfully led multilingual teams, managed high-stakes client portfolios in sectors like **Banking, Telecom, Insurance, E-commerce, and Utilities**, and consistently exceeded key performance metrics such as **NPS, SLA, and customer satisfaction**. I take pride in my ability to streamline operations, implement performance improvement plans, and build high-performing, agile teams that adapt quickly to business needs.

I bring over 7+ years of experience in process management and team leadership, with a strong focus on **data-driven decision-making. During my time at Continuum Global Solutions**, I had the opportunity to work on Power BI dashboards and performance tracking reports, which sparked my interest in data analysis. Since then, Iâ€™ve expanded my skill set to include **SQL, Power BI, and Python**. I am continuously learning how to turn raw data into actionable insights to drive efficiency and growth.

With a strong foundation in operations and an evolving capability in analytics, I aim to bridge the gap between customer experience and data intelligence, helping organizations scale with smarter strategies.
